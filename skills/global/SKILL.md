# global rules

## Update the doc in the same change as the thing it describes [R:doc-currency]

When you change a process, format, or artifact, update every checked-in description of it -- list, example, doc snippet -- in the same change. A doc that lags the code it describes is worse than no doc: a reader trusts it and acts on stale guidance. The behavior contract and its examples are only load-bearing if they are true.

Not to be confused with the sibling rule on a document's *internal* consistency
after an edit -- antecedents, cross-references, counts -- which currently lives
in the `~/.claude` skill layer under the tag this rule used to carry. This rule
is about a document's *external* currency: it still describes a reality that has
since moved. A file can pass one and fail the other.

The sibling is still named in prose rather than cited by tag, because it is not
in this library yet and a real citation would genuinely dangle. The *provenance*
above may now name it freely: since 2026-08-16 the linter reads citations from
rule bodies only, so recording why a tag changed no longer trips it.

## Make illegal states unrepresentable [R:make-illegal-states-unrepresentable]

Before writing logic, design the types so invalid states cannot be constructed: sum types over boolean flags, one field that cannot contradict another. If two fields can disagree, redesign until they cannot. R:no-sentinel-values is the corollary -- an absent or stopped state is an enum variant, not a magic value the surrounding logic must remember to special-case.

## Measure cost-per-completed-task; never choose by price tier [R:measure-cost-per-task]

Do not pick a mechanism or model by reputation or sticker price. State what it actually costs to complete the task -- tokens consumed times price, including retries -- and choose on that measured cost. After choosing, run one failure-mode check: under what configuration does this cause the exact harm it was chosen to prevent? Then bound that configuration.

## No sentinel values: absent states are enum variants [R:no-sentinel-values]

If "absent / stopped / unknown" is a real state, make it an enum variant, not a magic value of an existing type. Downstream code will forget to special-case a sentinel; it cannot forget a variant the compiler forces it to handle. If a range check reads a sentinel as a real quantity, it fails in the direction of the sentinel, not of safety.

## Never route judgment work to a weak model, and never embed a sub-tier local LLM [R:no-weak-model-for-judgment]

Work that needs judgment goes to a capable model. Do not embed a sub-tier local LLM (a 7B/13B behind Ollama, llama.cpp or similar) in a tool as a convenient, API-key-free fallback: a meaningfully dumber model degrades the tool it is wedged into, everywhere and silently, and the output looks like ordinary tool output rather than like a downgrade. When a tool needs intelligence, delegate to the capable model through the existing subscription -- the MCP server is the abstraction boundary and clients are peers. Note that the cost argument usually offered for the local model is the price-tier fallacy R:measure-cost-per-task names; but this rule is not an economic one and does not dissolve if the sums come out favourably. Mechanical, tool-restricted passes are a different matter and may be scoped tightly; the floor applies to work where the answer is a judgement.

## Pin the line endings of text a machine executes or hashes [R:pin-eol-for-executable-text]

When a file's exact bytes are load-bearing, do not leave its line endings to whatever the
checkout decides. Two kinds of file qualify: text a machine executes, where a stray
carriage return on the shebang means the interpreter is not found; and generated text
whose content is hashed and compared, where a rewritten line ending changes the hash and
the file reports as modified by a human who never touched it.

Pin it structurally, in `.gitattributes`, for the paths that need it. This is a
by-construction fix applied once at the repository boundary, not a check that runs later
and reports what has already gone wrong.

Do not repair this by teaching the comparison to forgive line endings. Normalising before
hashing makes the check tolerant of a class of real edit, and it hides the platform
difference rather than removing it. The guarantee is about the bytes on disk, so it is the
bytes on disk that must be fixed.

The characteristic damage is that it is invisible from where the work was done. The
authoring platform stays green; the breakage appears only on the other one, and it appears
as a symptom that names something else entirely -- a missing interpreter, a hand-edited
file, a failing gate with nothing wrong in the diff.

This is the at-rest half of a pair. Its sibling governs bytes in flight -- what another
tool emits into a pipe at runtime, which no file attribute can reach, so that fix belongs
at the consuming end instead. A repository can satisfy either and fail the other.

## Prefer by-construction impossibility over after-the-fact controls [R:prefer-by-construction]

When a class of mistake can be designed out, design it out, rather than adding a control that catches it after the fact. A control that catches a mistake still admits the mistake; a design that cannot express the mistake retires the whole class. Rank the options by how little must be remembered for them to hold: a type the compiler enforces beats a test that samples beats a review step that relies on attention. R:make-illegal-states-unrepresentable is this rule in the type system.

## Describe a practice from the artefact that defines it, never from the genre [R:source-practice-from-its-artefact]

Before writing anything that *describes* how the user works -- their process, their file
layout, their tooling, their organisation, their role -- enumerate the primary artefacts
that define it, and read them first. The definition of a practice is the artefact that
embodies it: the skill that specifies it, the repository that implements it, the document
that governs it. Domain literature and industry convention describe the *genre*, not this
instance. A description sourced from the genre will be fluent, well-structured, plausible,
and about somebody else.

Run this check before drafting, not after: **what artefact would prove this description
wrong, and have I read it?** If the answer names a file that has not been opened, open it.
If no such artefact exists, the description is an assumption -- ask, and say plainly that
the question is being asked because nothing available settles it.

Clarifying questions must cover the *subject*, not only the framing. Asking about audience,
evidence and venue while silently assuming what the thing is produces a well-scoped,
well-sourced artefact about the wrong topic, and the correction costs a rewrite rather than
an edit. The cheapest question is the one that establishes what is being described.

This is the reading half of the sibling rule on building: search the existing artefacts
before constructing something new. That one prevents rebuilding what exists; this one
prevents *describing* what does not.

## Verify through the production path [R:verify-through-production-path]

Before declaring anything verified, run at least one check through the exact channel production uses: same env var, same startup script, same config file, same transport. A test that exercises a stand-in is evidence the stand-in works, not that the feature does. Ask: which line of production wiring did my test NOT execute? That line is where it breaks.
