# domain: project-files rules

## The project charter is written to the recreation standard [R:claude-md-recreates-the-project]

Write the project charter so that from it alone the project could be rebuilt. That is the bar, and it is testable: hand the file to someone with the toolchain and nothing else, and ask what they could not reconstruct.

It holds the purpose, the core design decisions **with their reasons**, the invariants that must never break, the commands to build, run and test, and pointers to the other standing documents. The reasons are the part that decays first and matters most: a decision recorded without its why is indistinguishable from an accident, so the next reader either reverses it or preserves it superstitiously, and both are expensive.

Check it explicitly on every change that touches design, as a question rather than a glance: *could this file still recreate the project?* Skipping that check is how the standard becomes a lie -- not in one edit, but in twenty, each individually defensible.

The charter is the project layer and nothing else. Domain rules are referenced from it, never copied into it (R:five-files-no-more), and a claim it makes about an enforcing control is subject to R:guarantee-needs-a-reader like any other.

## The decisions log records the why and what was rejected, append-only [R:decisions-log-records-rejected-alternatives]

Keep an append-only decisions log in the architecture document: date, decision, why, alternatives rejected. Append; never rewrite an entry to match what was later believed, because the value of the log is that it records what was known at the time.

The rejected alternatives are the half that gets dropped and the half that pays. A decision with its reason tells the next reader why this path was taken; the rejected list tells them why *their* idea was not, which is the question they actually have. Without it, the obvious alternative is re-proposed on a cycle set by staff turnover, and each round costs the same argument with less context than the last.

Anonymous structure accumulates as sediment. Given a module boundary with no recorded reason, a reader must either treat it as sacred or treat it as arbitrary, and neither is true. Write the entry when the decision is made, while the alternatives are still in mind -- reconstructed later, the rejected list is always the flattering one.

Record the decision that surprised you most, not the one that was easiest to write down. This is the same discipline R:claude-md-recreates-the-project applies to the charter: what a future reader cannot reconstruct is exactly what must be written.

## The definition of done runs on every change, and skips are declared [R:definition-of-done-every-change]

A change is not done until five checks pass, in order:

1. **Code and its enforcing artefact ship together.** The type, property or test that locks the new behaviour is in the same change. Never "tests later" -- later is a different change, made by someone with less context, competing against new work.
2. **Regression pass.** Re-read the behaviour contract and *run* the enforcing artefacts of every feature this change could plausibly touch. A fix that breaks another documented feature is not a fix. This is the check that makes the contract protective rather than descriptive.
3. **The contract is updated** -- a new entry with its artefact, or an existing entry's artefact revised.
4. **Charter and architecture sync.** Ask explicitly whether the charter could still recreate the project and whether the architecture still describes it, and append any decision made to the log with its why.
5. **The open-work list is updated** -- done items cleared, discovered work added.

State the five results at the end of the task, briefly. The statement is not ceremony: it is what makes a skipped check visible to the person who can price the skip.

When a request conflicts with the discipline -- *just patch it quickly* -- do the patch, then say which checks were skipped and what exposure that creates. Never silently drop the discipline, and never block the user with process. The skip is the user's call to make; concealing that it happened is not.

Checks 1 and 2 do not apply to every change, and saying so is part of doing them. A documentation-only change has no enforcing artefact to ship. Declaring a check inapplicable is honest; quietly omitting it and reporting five greens is the failure this rule names.

## Every feature-ledger entry names the artefact that enforces it, or declares itself exposed [R:features-ledger-names-its-artefact]

Every entry in the behaviour contract carries the artefact that enforces it: the type that makes violation unrepresentable, the property test that covers the space, or the named unit test that pins the case. No entry without one.

Where a feature genuinely cannot be enforced yet, the entry says so in those words -- **exposed, nothing yet** -- and the gap goes to the open-work list until it closes. That is not a failure of the ledger; it is the ledger working. What must never happen is a row that reads like a guarantee because it is written in the same voice as the rows beside it.

Prefer the artefact highest in the hierarchy that can hold the guarantee: a type beats a property beats a unit test. And the artefact must exercise the **wired** behaviour, not the component alone -- R:wired-artifact is the sharp edge here, because a type's own unit tests prove the type works and say nothing about whether anything produces or consumes it.

Record the **invocation**, not only the artefact. A test that exists and is never run is enforcement on paper: name the command, and require that the command named is the one the pipeline actually takes. A gate whose green invocation needs a flag teaches every reader that the default is noisy, and that is how a control decays into decoration.

The ledger is only load-bearing if it is read before every change, which is what makes R:definition-of-done-every-change its second check rather than a courtesy.

## A project carries five standing documents, and resists a sixth [R:five-files-no-more]

A project keeps exactly five standing documents, each with one job:

- `CLAUDE.md` — the recreation standard: purpose, design decisions with their *why*, invariants, build and test commands.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — modules, data flow, perimeter, and an append-only decisions log.
- `FEATURES.md` — the regression ledger, every entry naming the artefact that enforces it.
- `TODO.md` — open work, including every unenforced gap the ledger declares.
- `README.md` — the public face, and the only one of the five written for outsiders. Keep the other four written for the maintainer and the machine.

Resist the sixth. Every resident document taxes attention on the others, and the tax is paid by the documents that matter most, because they are the longest. New standing knowledge goes *into* one of the five, or into a domain rule if it generalises past this project -- never into a new file whose creation felt tidy at the time.

The two failure classes the set exists to kill are staleness and unenforced guarantees. A file claiming completeness that has drifted is a confident lie, and confident stale context is read and acted on; a documented feature with no executable check is shipped and inert. Both are worse than the absence of the document, because both stop people looking.

Do not duplicate domain rules into the project layer. Reference them. A rule stated in two places forks and rots, and the copy is always the one someone reads.
