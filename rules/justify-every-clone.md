A borrow-checker error is a question about ownership. `clone()` does not answer it; it pays to avoid answering it. Try the answers first: restructure so one owner is obvious, take a borrow with a named lifetime, split the borrow across smaller fields, or share with `Arc`/`Rc` where the value is genuinely shared rather than copied.

Where a clone survives that examination, write the reason beside it, in the house form used throughout this codebase:

```rust
let sources: Vec<RuleTag> = rules.iter().map(|r| r.tag().clone()).collect(); // allow:clone: the OutputFile owns its provenance, outliving the &Library borrow
```

The comment is what makes the rule reviewable. Unannotated clones are indistinguishable from one another, so a reviewer has to re-derive the ownership argument for every one and in practice re-derives it for none. An annotated clone states a claim that can be checked, and that can be found and removed the day the design around it changes.

The reason must be about ownership or lifetime. "To make it compile" is the error class restated, not a justification. Two copies of a value the code believes is one value is a correctness bug waiting for whoever mutates the wrong one.

Most clones that survive review were created by a signature, not by a call site: R:borrow-in-signatures is where the pressure comes from, and fixing the parameter usually deletes the clone rather than annotating it.
