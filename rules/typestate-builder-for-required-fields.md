Surfaced when the emitted Copilot artefact was audited against that pattern list and ten practices were found to have no rule in this library -- so they reached Claude through the always-on boot index and reached no other assistant at all. A practice that lives in one vendor's instruction layer only is the vendor lock this tool exists to remove."

Track each required field in a phantom type parameter, and implement `build()` only for the fully populated combination:

```rust
pub struct Missing;
pub struct Present;
pub struct ServerBuilder<HasHost, HasUser> { /* ... */ }
impl ServerBuilder<Present, Present> { pub fn build(self) -> Server { /* ... */ } }
```

An incomplete build is then not an error value to handle but a method that does not exist. Compare the alternative: `build()` returns `Result<_, MissingField>`, every caller writes the same `?`, and the one caller who writes `unwrap_or_default()` ships a server pointing at nothing.

This is R:typestate-for-protocols applied to construction rather than to sequence -- the same remedy, a different illegal thing. Optional fields stay plain setters; only what is genuinely required earns a parameter.

Beyond three or four required fields the parameter list costs more than the problem. Take a required-arguments struct in `new()` instead: the same omission is still a compile error, with none of the machinery.
