It surfaced in an audit of an emitted instruction artefact against the hand-written pattern list it was supposed to replace: ten practices were stated in that one hand-maintained layer and had no rule in the library, so they reached a single assistant and travelled to no other tool — which is the failure the library exists to prevent, arriving in the library's own contents. The practice: each distinct failure is a variant carrying the values that identify the instance, so a caller can match on it rather than parsing prose that changes the next time somebody edits a message, and one log line names the actual address or path instead of starting an investigation."

Every distinct failure is a variant of a `thiserror` enum, and every variant carries the values that identify the instance:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum ConnectError {
    #[error("TCP connect to {addr} failed")]
    Tcp { addr: SocketAddr, #[source] source: io::Error },
    #[error("timed out after {elapsed:?}")]
    Timeout { elapsed: Duration },
}
```

Two things follow that a string cannot give. The caller can `match` -- retry a `Timeout`, surface a `Tcp` -- rather than parsing prose that changes the next time someone edits a message. And the message names the actual address, so one log line is enough to act on rather than the start of an investigation.

Keep the cause in `#[source]` instead of interpolating it into the text. The chain then prints once, at the edge, without each layer restating the layer beneath it.

One variant per condition a caller could plausibly treat differently. Collapsing four causes into `Other(String)` re-creates the string error inside an enum: it reads as a type and behaves as prose, and it is the shape this rule exists to catch.
