# Rules for domain: rust

## Design by writing the types first, before any logic [R:design-types-first]

Sketch the types until the design falls out, then write the logic. The type-level sketch is the executable specification a test-first red phase is reaching for, and it is the stronger one: a test samples points of the behaviour space, a type constrains the whole space and the compiler proves it everywhere, at compile time, for as long as the code exists. When the types are right much of the implementation writes itself, and many wrong implementations stop compiling. In Rust this ordering supersedes any test-first default -- tests are not removed, they are demoted to the layer where they are the right tool: property tests for behavioural laws the types cannot encode, unit tests as regression pins for past bugs. Apply each guarantee at the strongest layer that can hold it, and when reviewing, ask first not "does it pass" but "which of these guarantees could move up a layer?"

## Newtype liberally: distinct concepts get distinct types [R:newtype-liberally]

Give every domain concept its own type, even when the underlying representation is identical. `Miles(f64)` and `Kilometers(f64)`, `Host(String)` and `Port(u16)` -- never two bare `f64`s or a `String` and a `u16` whose order only a human remembers. Newtypes are zero-cost: they compile to the same machine code as the primitive, so the only thing they add is the compile error you want. The unit mix-up that cannot be written is cheaper than the one caught in review, and far cheaper than the one that is not. R:parse-dont-validate is where the newtype comes from -- the boundary mints it as a witness; this rule is about carrying it everywhere afterwards instead of unwrapping back to the primitive.

## No anyhow in library return types [R:no-anyhow-in-libraries]

> Also enforced by hook:no-anyhow-in-lib.

Library crates return typed error enums (thiserror), so a Result says exactly what can go wrong and callers can match on it. anyhow belongs only at the outermost binary edge. This rule has graduated: the no-anyhow-in-lib hook now enforces it deterministically at write time.

## No unwrap() in production code [R:no-unwrap-in-production]

> Also enforced by hook:no-unwrap-in-src.

No unwrap() in production code. Use expect() only with a meaningful panic message that names the resource and the invariant, or return the error with `?` and let the caller decide how to surface it. This rule has graduated: the no-unwrap-in-src hook now enforces it deterministically at write time, so the instruction layer no longer has to.

## Parse, don't validate [R:parse-dont-validate]

Transform raw input into a rich domain type at the outermost boundary, producing a witness newtype whose existence proves the check happened. Interior code takes the witness and never re-checks -- one perimeter, one check, enforced everywhere after by the compiler. R:parse-wide-then-range-check sharpens this: the boundary must be able to see the illegal value in order to name it.

## Parse wide, then range-check [R:parse-wide-then-range-check]

Parse into a type wide enough to *represent* the out-of-range value, then range-check to mint the narrow newtype. The perimeter must be able to see the illegal value in order to name it illegal; parsing directly into the target type collapses "out of range" into "not a number" and makes the OutOfRange class a lie the compiler will not catch.

## Typestate for protocols: out-of-order calls should not compile [R:typestate-for-protocols]

When a sequence has rules -- connect before authenticate, init before run, configure before start -- encode the stage in the type, not in a field. Each step consumes the value in one state and produces it in the next, so a method that is invalid in the current state simply does not exist and calling it is a compile error. This is R:make-illegal-states-unrepresentable applied to time rather than to structure: the illegal thing is not a contradictory pair of fields but an operation at the wrong moment, and the same remedy applies -- make it unrepresentable rather than guarded. A runtime `if !self.authenticated { return Err(...) }` in a method that should not exist yet is the shape to look for.
